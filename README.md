# SmartAttend

AI-assisted classroom attendance built with Streamlit and Supabase.
Teachers take attendance from classroom **photos** (face recognition) or a **voice** recording;
students sign in with their face, join subjects by code/link/QR and see their own attendance.

## Features
- Landing page, teacher sign-up/login (bcrypt), student FaceID sign-in and registration
- Subjects with unique join codes, join link + QR (when `APP_BASE_URL` is set)
- Face attendance from multiple photos, restricted to students enrolled in the subject
- Optional voice attendance (Resemblyzer speaker embeddings)
- Review-before-save, duplicate-safe saving, overview dashboard, records, CSV export

## Quick start (local)
```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt            # voice deps (PyTorch) are large; see below
cp .env.example .env                        # then fill in SUPABASE_URL / SUPABASE_KEY
set -a && source .env && set +a             # or use .streamlit/secrets.toml instead
streamlit run app.py
```
Without credentials the app shows a setup screen instead of crashing.

### Database
Run `supabase/schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor. **It was inferred from the code** (the repo had no schema):
compare it with your existing tables first. It is idempotent and non-destructive. It enables RLS with no public
policies; the app uses a **server-side key** and enforces authorisation in `src/database/db.py`.

### Configuration
| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY` | Required. Server-side only; never commit or expose. |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Public app URL for join links/QR (optional). |
| `FACE_MATCH_THRESHOLD` | Max face distance for a match (default 0.6; lower = stricter). |
| `VOICE_MATCH_THRESHOLD` | Min cosine similarity for a voice match (default 0.65). |

Read from environment variables first, then `.streamlit/secrets.toml`.

### Voice features
`resemblyzer` installs PyTorch (large). If it is missing, the app still runs and voice features show a clear message.

## Tests
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest tests -q
```
- `tests/test_services.py`, `tests/test_db.py`: business logic and DB layer (against an **in-memory fake**, `tests/fake_supabase.py`).
- `tests/test_app_flows.py`: headless UI flows via `streamlit.testing` (fake DB).
- `tests/test_face_real.py`: runs the **real dlib models** on public sample photos (downloaded at test time, skipped offline).
- `streamlit run tests/dev_fake_backend.py`: run the real app on a seeded in-memory DB (demo teacher `demo` / `demo-password`). Dev only.

## Deployment
Any host that runs `streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0` works (Streamlit Community Cloud, a container, a VM).
Set the variables above as the host's secrets. Health check: `GET /_stcore/health` returns `ok`.
Use HTTPS (camera and microphone access require it in browsers). Not verified on a live host.

## Security notes
- Never commit `.env` or `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (both git-ignored). **Rotate any key that was ever exposed**, including the Supabase key that triggered GitHub push protection.
- Photos and audio are processed in memory; only numeric embeddings and attendance rows are stored. Embeddings are biometric data: obtain consent and check local regulations.
- Student sign-in is face-only with **no liveness check**: a printed photo may pass. Login attempts are not rate-limited across sessions.
- Sessions live in Streamlit session state: a browser refresh signs the user out.

## Recognition integrity, marks and migrations (stage 2)

**Run migrations in order in the Supabase SQL editor** (additive, non-destructive; compare with your DB first):
`supabase/schema.sql` -> `supabase/migrations/002_attendance_integrity.sql` -> `supabase/migrations/003_marks.sql`.
The app still saves attendance on a database without 002 (legacy columns), but audited corrections and marks need 002/003.

**How a face is decided:** detect -> embed -> match. Each face is `matched`, `ambiguous`, `duplicate` or `unknown`; only
`matched` is auto-present. Everything else is listed for the teacher in an editable review table. Detection and recognition
do not prove physical presence.

New settings: `FACE_MATCH_MARGIN`, `FACE_NUM_JITTERS`, `FACE_MIN_SIZE_PX`, `VOICE_MATCH_MARGIN` (see `src/settings.py`).

**Known limitations:** no liveness/anti-spoofing; thresholds and margins are not validated on real data (see
`evaluation/README.md`); voice model not exercised in CI; marks DB triggers untested; per-user RLS requires Supabase Auth.
Full per-item status: `docs/STATUS.md`.

**Data in `class_data/` is synthetic** and must not be used as an accuracy benchmark or imported into production.

## Hardening update: accounts, validation, Supabase

- **Teacher accounts are invitation-only.** There is no public teacher sign-up. See `docs/SECURITY.md` for the first-administrator procedure.
- **Run migrations `004` then (after review) `005`** and `supabase/verify_security.sql`. The app refuses to start with a public Supabase key.
- **No classifier to retrain.** Face matching is a distance search over stored embeddings, cached per *gallery version*; a new enrolment is visible to every instance immediately. `FACE_MATCH_THRESHOLD`, `FACE_MATCH_MARGIN` are unchanged.
- New optional settings: `ADMIN_SETUP_TOKEN`, `LOGIN_MAX_FAILURES`, `LOGIN_WINDOW_MINUTES`, `STUDENT_REGISTER_PER_HOUR`.
- Breaking changes for scripts/tests: `db.get_enrolled_students(teacher_id, subject_id)` and `db.save_attendance_session(logs, teacher_id)` now require the acting teacher.
